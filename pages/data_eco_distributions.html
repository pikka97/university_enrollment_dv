          In this page we analyze the Universities Enrollment dataset as different economical distributions, focusing on the differences between the countries and regions.
          <!-- In this page we show the number of the universities groupped by the corresponding income group.
          Notice that there is a number of universities which are not groupped, we collect them under an Unknown income group.
          <br><br>
          Income groups in the context of university enrollment refer to classifications of students based on their family's financial status.
          These classifications are typically used to assess the financial need of students and to determine eligibility for financial aid.
          Different universities and countries may use different income group definitions, but they generally follow a similar structure. -->

    <div class="row">
        <div id="bar_chart_total_fields_by_regions"></div>
        <p>A compelling observation emerges from the data: institutions in higher-income groups consistently offer a wider range of degree programs. This direct correlation between income and program diversity stems from the ample resources available to institutions in these regions, enabling them to invest heavily in course development and faculty recruitment.</p>

        <p>North America and Europe stand out as the hubs of comprehensive degree programs, aligning with their status as regions boasting the highest average income levels. These regions have a long-standing tradition of prioritizing higher education, maintaining their position at the forefront of innovation and research.</p>

        <p>Asia Pacific (APAC) institutions are rapidly expanding their offerings of degree programs, steadily catching up to their North American and European counterparts. This progress is fueled by a combination of factors, including economic growth, rising demand for higher education, and supportive government policies that encourage private higher education.</p>

        <p>In contrast, LATAM and MENA institutions still lag behind in terms of program diversity, a situation likely attributed to a combination of factors such as lower economic development levels, historical educational disparities, and regulatory constraints.</p>

        <p>The availability of a wide range of degree programs holds significant implications for higher education accessibility. Institutions with a diverse portfolio of offerings are better equipped to cater to the needs of a diverse student population, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds who may not have access to traditional college preparatory pathways.</p>

        <p>While program diversity is crucial, it is equally important to ensure the quality and relevance of the programs offered. Institutions should not merely focus on increasing the number of programs; they must uphold the highest standards of quality and ensure that their offerings align with the demands of the current and future workforce.</p>

        <p>Governments play a pivotal role in supporting the expansion of degree programs in LATAM and MENA regions. This could involve providing funding for course development and faculty recruitment, as well as easing regulatory barriers that hinder program growth.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, the number of degree programs offered by institutions serves as a crucial indicator of higher education quality and accessibility. By examining program trends across income groups, we can identify areas for improvement and advocate for policy changes that promote equitable access to a comprehensive range of educational opportunities.</p>
